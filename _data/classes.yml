#   name: Model of Personal Informatics Systems
#   description: >
#     This is a model of personal informatics systems that we hope would be valuable for research and development.
#     It provides a common framework for describing, comparing, and evaluating the growing number of this class of systems.
#     This model is composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action).
#     These stages have four properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative;
#     they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted.

#   name: My Agent as Myself
#   description: >
#     My Agent as Myself studies what happens when users interact with embodied conversational agents that look like them.
#     Would users follow the agents' advice? Users in the study created faces for agents, one that resembled them and one that is suitable for providing feedback.
#     We found when someone else created the faces, users listened more to faces that resembled them.
#     However, when users created the faces, they listened less to their own face.
